<h1 class="font_sixtyfour">About Nick</h1>
<p class="font_roboto-condensed post_p">
  I've built a lot of different platforms, apps, and services and have worked
  for large enterprise and tiny startups. Small teams wearing many hats, and
  larger teams with differing skill levels where I had a concentration on
  leveling up my colleagues. I lead a mobile team for the largest healthcare org
  in the us and I have singlehandedly built dozens of services currently in
  production today that healthy businesses continue to leverage. I enjoy being
  involved early in the process and collaborating with a cross functional team
  to solve problems. Constantly driven for simplicity. Less is Less. Velocity is
  a conscious choice.

  I enjoy collaborative conversations and am humble about actual code, rather
  find the most effective solution than always be right, and many times the best
  solution is not an engineering solve, but rather deeper understanding of the
  requirements and framing of a product/design solution. "Fall in love with the
  problem"

  Influenced by BrooklynJS, React Rally, Lead Dev, Datadog DASH, Google Cloud
  Next and other conferences, and the book "Kill It with Fire: Manage Aging
  Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones)" is required reading for
  anyone currently in or aiming for a technical leadership role.
