<p class="font_roboto-condensed post_p">Messing around with go and HTMX and html templates to make a simple blog in a
    way that
    is new to me. I've gone through a few iterations of blog approaches/sites and maybe this is the one that will stick
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<p class="font_roboto-condensed post_p">So far this post / content files are html file(s), I know markdown seems like a
    more popular option for dev blogs etc, but I kinda like the idea of writing vanilla html files for content here,
    especially when llm assisted for styling or formatting.</p>

<p class="font_roboto-condensed post_p">I'm betting on leveraging more classic web such as html css files etc, and
    that we will continue to see less tooling/abstractions for dev experience since devs are now llm assisted. The
    fastest sites out there are just cached css and html right, why jump through all the hoops when you can generate the
    styles instantly and then spot check. This post written out and css file generated/styled by hand quickly as you can
    tell, but I mean for the future !</p>
